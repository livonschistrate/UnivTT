# UnivTT

This is my Bachelor's degree final project, UnivTT, a timetable management application for universities. 
This software allows the creation of timetables in an university, and it has two major sections: 
- the public section, which displays the timetable information for everyone, including students and professors
- the private section (accessible to teachers/admins), which implies generating timetables, manually or automatically, account management and timetable information editing
